<a id="about-tallinn-manual"></a>

Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare was prepared by an international group of legal and military experts at the invitation of NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence. The first manual was edited by General Michael N. Schmitt and published by Cambridge University Press in 2013. It was followed by Tallinn Manual 2.0, published in 2017, which covers international law applicable to cyber incidents between states below the threshold of armed conflict. This game is based on the first Tallinn Manual, which concentrates on severe cyber operations, violating the prohibition of the use of force, which can take place during an armed conflict and self-defence. In the absence of binding regulations, Tallinn Manual represents the most authoritative source and the most advanced effort to define the rules of cyber warfare based on existing conventions, treaties and customary international law.



# About the Game
<a id="about-the-game"></a>

Cyber Crisis revolves around two neighbouring countries Patria and Inimicus that have declared war against each other. Apart from conventional warfare in the bordering regions, hostilities involve cyber operations. Your goal, as an Officer in charge of Patria’s cyber operations unit is to conduct cyber operations against Inimicus without violating international laws applicable to cyber warfare. In each round you will be presented with two options, one of which will contain legal action and the other one an illegal action. Illegal actions will result in sanctions from the international community, which will affect Patria’s economy and the ability to wage war. After each action you will be able to see how your action affected the economic situation of the country and will be able to read the explanation based on Tallinn Manual rules on why the action you selected would be legal/illegal. Your actions will be followed by counteractions from Inimicus’ cyber operations unit. The adversary will commit both legal and illegal actions during the game and get sanctioned accordingly. At the end of the game the country with the best economic situation will win the game.



# General Rules from Tallinn Manual
<a id="general-rules-from-tallinn-manual"></a>


## State Responsibility
<a id="state-responsibility"></a>

According to the Rule 6 of the Tallinn Manual state has legal responsibility over the cyber operations that are attributable to that state and violate international obligations. Rule 6 reflects customary international law on state responsibility, such as ILC Articles on State Responsibility, Hague Convention and I Additional Protocol to Geneva Conventions. Violations, such as actions or failure to act that lead to violation of UN Charter or laws of armed conflict are attributable to the state when, for example, such actions are committed by an organ of state acting in an official capacity.

Rules 7 and 8 specify that when a cyber operation is conducted from or is routed through the government’s cyber infrastructure, it can be an indication of the state's involvement in the operation but is not sufficient evidence to attribute the attack to the state.



## Prohibition of the use of force
<a id="prohibition-of-the-use-of-force"></a>

Rule 10 of the Tallinn Manual, based on UN Charter Article 2(4) prohibits cyber operations that constitute a threat or use of force that is inconsistent with the UN Charter, against another state. Rule 13 based on UN Charter Article 51 explains that a state that is under armed attack, in this case in the form of cyber operation, can exercise self-defence. According to Rule 14 during the self-defence cyber operations should be necessary and proportionate.



## Countermeasures
<a id="countermeasures"></a>

Rule 9 of the Tallinn Manual is reflecting ILC Articles on State Responsibility and states, that an injured state, that has been affected by an internationally wrongful act, can implement countermeasures, which, in this case, include cyber countermeasures, against the state responsible for the wrongful act. These countermeasures should be necessary and proportionate, and their purpose should be to induce the state responsible for the wrongful act to comply with international obligations.



## What is a cyber attack and what constitutes a use of force in cyber operations
<a id="what-is-a-cyber-attack-and-what-constitutes-a-use-of-force-in-cyber-operations"></a>

Rule 30 of the Tallinn Manual specifies the definition of a cyber attack as a defensive or offensive cyber operation, as a result of which it can be reasonably expected to damage/destroy objects or injure/kill persons. This definition is drawn from the I Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions.

According to the Tallinn Manual Rule 11 cyber operation constitutes a use of force when its scale and effect is similar to the non-cyber operation, that would constitute a use of force. Based on the UN Charter and ICJ Nicaragua judgement, Tallinn Manual specifies several criteria that can be used to identify whether a cyber operation can constitute a use of force. These are: Severity, Immediacy, Directness, Invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvements and presumptive legality.



## Criminal Responsibility of commanders and superiors
<a id="criminal-responsibility-of-commanders-and-superiors"></a>

Rule 24 of the Tallinn Manual reflects Geneva Conventions and Rome Statute when stating that commanders and superiors are criminally responsible when cyber operations ordered by them constitute war crimes. They are also responsible when they know, or should have known about the war crimes committed or about to be committed by their subordinates and fail to act to prevent or punish such crimes.



## Means and Methods of Warfare
<a id="means-and-methods-of-warfare"></a>

Tallinn Manual Rule 41 defines means and methods of cyber warfare, stating that means of cyber warfare are cyber weapons and associated cyber systems, whereas methods of cyber warfare are cyber tactics, techniques and procedures used to conduct hostilities. Manual calls for the distinction between computer systems that can be considered as means of warfare and cyber infrastructure such as the internet that can not be considered as such as it is not in the control of the warring party.

Rule 54 of the Manual is based on I Additional Protocol to Geneva Conventions and states, that when deciding on conducting a cyber attack, all feasible precautions must be taken by those who plan or approve the attack when choosing means and methods of cyber warfare in order to avoid or at least minimise incidental injury/death of civilians or damage/destruction to civilian objects.


## Distinction
<a id="distinction"></a>

Principle of distinction is a customary international law principle that has been codified in the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols. Tallinn Manual Rule 31 also applies the principle of distinction to cyber attacks, calling on warring parties to distinguish between civilian population and combatants on the one hand and civilian objects and military objectives on the other.

Rule 32, based on the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions, prohibits attacking civilian populations or individuals, whereas rule 37 prohibits attacking civilian objects.

Rule 34 defines lawful objects of attack, including cyber attacks, that are members of armed forces, organised armed groups, civilians that take direct part in hostilities, and participants in mass national conscription. Rule 38 draws a distinction between civilian objects and military objectives stating that an object can be considered a military objective according to its nature, location, purpose, or use, which would lead to its effective military contribution.

Tallinn Manual Rules also specify groups and objects that are under special protection, such as medical and religious personnel, medical units and transport (Rule 70), medical computers, computer networks and data (Rule 71), UN personnel, installations, material, units and vehicles (Rule 74), Journalists (Rule 79), objects indispensable to survival (Rule 81), cultural property (Rule 82), natural environment (Rule 83) and diplomatic archives and communications (Rule 84). Additionally, Rule 80 calls for particular care during cyber attacks on installations that contain dangerous forces, such as dykes, dams, and nuclear electrical generating stations.



## Proportionality
<a id="proportionality"></a>

Reflecting International Humanitarian Law, Tallinn Manual Rule 51 states that incidental injury/death of civilians or damage/destruction of civilian objects that can be caused by cyber operations should not be excessive in relation to the military advantage that is anticipated as a result of the operation.

Rule 55 calls on taking precautions by planners and decision makers behind the cyber operation when it might cause incidental injury/death of civilians or damage/destruction of civilian objects and not plan/launch operations where civilian harm would be excessive to anticipated military advantage.



## Precautions
<a id="precautions"></a>

Based on the I Additional Protocol to Geneva Conventions, Rule 52 calls on warring parties to take constant care in order to avoid harming civilian populations, individuals and objects. 

To this end, Rule 53, reflecting customary international law, calls on planners and decision makers behind the cyber operation to do everything feasible to verify the objectives of the attack, to make sure that they are not civilian objects or objects that enjoy special protection.

Customary international law also includes warnings, when circumstances allow for it, given in advance to the civilian population that could be affected by the attack. This is codified in I Additional Protocol to Geneva Conventions and Hague Regulations. Rule 58 of the Tallinn Manual also calls for such warnings during cyber operations.

Rule 59 further calls for precautions when it comes to the potential effects of cyber attacks. According to the rule, which reflects customary international law of international armed conflicts, warring parties should take precautions to the maximum extent that is possible to protect the civilian population, individuals and objects from the dangers that can arise due to cyber attacks conducted by them.
